### Invited Talk:  *Getting Computer Systems Ready for Visual Computing in Ten Years*

**Abstract**

Addressing the world's more pressing issues such as environmental sustainability and cultural heritage preservation increasingly relies on diverse visual applications running on emerging platforms such as AR/VR headsets, autonomous machines, and smart sensor nodes. In real-time and using low power, visual computing systems must generate visual data for human to consume, immersively, or interpret visual data to provide personalized services, intelligently.

In this talk, I will explain why today's computer systems and architecture are not ready for the visual computing on the horizon, and outline the road that might get us there. Fundamentally, we must innovate both horizontally, by co-designing across different domains that are conventionally designed and optimized in isolation, and vertically, by rethinking the systems stack for 3D perception.
