_Under Construction_

## International Workshop on Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Systems
April 5, 2020 -- Boston, Massachusetts, USA

In conjunction with **[ISPASS 2020](https://www.ispass.org/ispass2020)**

## Background
[FastPath 2020](https://fastpath2020.github.io) brings together researchers and practitioners involved in cross-stack hardware/software performance analysis, modeling, and evaluation for efficient machine learning systems. Machine learning demands tremendous amount of computing. Current machine learning systems are diverse, including cellphones, high performance computing systems, database systems, self-driving cars, robotics, and in-home appliances. Many machine-learning systems have customized hardware and/or software. The types and components of such systems vary, but a partial list includes traditional CPUs assisted with accelerators (ASICs, FPGAs, GPUs), memory accelerators, I/O accelerators, hybrid systems, converged infrastructure, and IT appliances. Designing efficient machine learning systems poses several challenges.

These include distributed training on big data, hyper-parameter tuning for models, emerging accelerators, fast I/O for random inputs, approximate computing for training and inference, programming models for a diverse machine-learning workloads, high-bandwidth interconnect, efficient mapping of processing logic on hardware, and cross system stack performance optimization. Emerging infrastructure supporting big data analytics, cognitive computing, large-scale machine learning, mobile computing, and internet-of-things, exemplify system designs optimized for machine learning at large.

## Topics
FastPath seeks to facilitate the exchange of ideas on performance analysis and evaluation of machine learning/AI systems and seeks papers on a wide range of topics including, but not limited to:

- Workload characterization, performance modeling and profiling of machine learning applications
- GPUs, FPGAs, ASIC accelerators
- Memory, I/O, storage, network accelerators
- Hardware/software co-design
- Efficient machine learning algorithms
- Approximate computing in machine learning
- Power/Energy and learning acceleration
- Software, library, and runtime for machine learning systems
- Workload scheduling and orchestration
- Machine learning in cloud systems
- Large-scale machine learning systems
- Emerging intelligent/cognitive systems
- Converged/integrated infrastructure
- Machine learning systems for specific domains, e.g., financial, biological, education, commerce, healthcare

## Submission
The FastPath 2020 Call for Papers is available **[here](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-ealtman/FastPath2019CFP.pdf)**.

Prospective authors must submit a 2-4 page extended abstract electronically on **[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fastpath2020)**

Authors of selected abstracts will be invited to give a 30-min presentation at the workshop.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/FastPath2020/FastPath2020.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/FastPath2020/FastPath2020.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
