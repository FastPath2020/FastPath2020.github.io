## International Workshop on Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Systems
April 5, 2020 -- Boston, Massachusetts, USA

In conjunction with **[ISPASS 2020](https://www.ispass.org/ispass2020)**

## Background
[FastPath 2020](https://fastpath2020.github.io) brings together researchers and practitioners involved in cross-stack hardware/software performance analysis, modeling, and evaluation for efficient machine learning systems. Machine learning demands tremendous amount of computing. Current machine learning systems are diverse, including cellphones, high performance computing systems, database systems, self-driving cars, robotics, and in-home appliances. Many machine-learning systems have customized hardware and/or software. The types and components of such systems vary, but a partial list includes traditional CPUs assisted with accelerators (ASICs, FPGAs, GPUs), memory accelerators, I/O accelerators, hybrid systems, converged infrastructure, and IT appliances. Designing efficient machine learning systems poses several challenges.

These include distributed training on big data, hyper-parameter tuning for models, emerging accelerators, fast I/O for random inputs, approximate computing for training and inference, programming models for a diverse machine-learning workloads, high-bandwidth interconnect, efficient mapping of processing logic on hardware, and cross system stack performance optimization. Emerging infrastructure supporting big data analytics, cognitive computing, large-scale machine learning, mobile computing, and internet-of-things, exemplify system designs optimized for machine learning at large.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/FastPath2020/FastPath2020.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
